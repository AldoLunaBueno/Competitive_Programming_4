#Â Fun House - Kattis

# Reasoning
#
# Each house is interpreted 
# rotating the string representation 90 degrees counterclockwise.
# The solution is simulate the movement of a ray of light. 
# For each iteration the position moves (straight or reflected by a mirror)
# one unit to an adyacent position until it reaches a wall, 
# where the exit should be.
#
# Details
#
# x and y defines position.
# axis and sign defines direction.
# - axis can be horizontal (True) of vertical (False)
# - sign can be positive (True) or negative (False)
# This definition of direction makes it 
# easy to update it when a mirror appears 
# by fliping the axis or the axis and the sign 
# depending on mirror type and direction of incidence.
# The next position is determined by the current position and direction
