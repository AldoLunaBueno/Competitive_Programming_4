#Â Almost Union-Find
# RUNTIME: 	0.41 s
#
# Reasoning:
#
# The extra operation called move challenges a typical union-find structure
# in one specific way:
# If we move a non-leaf node A to B, where A and B aren't together, just by letting A points B,
# A's children now are part of B set, which is nonsense (we want to move just A).
#
# Our solution solves this issue by removing the premise in the first place:
# there isn't any non-leaf node to move, never!
# This is achieved by a clever extension of the "parent" array,
# where the non-leaf nodes are never accessed from the outside
# because they are in the same array, but after all the accessible nodes.
# The accessible nodes point from the beginning to these non-leaf nodes
# (so accessible nodes are leaves and non-leaf nodes are roots 
# from the beginning).
#
# Here, for example, A and B are the only accessible nodes (n=2), 
# but they point to RA and RB (the real roots):
#       parent = [0, A, B, RA, RB]
# If we do A union B, we really do RA union RB.
#
# There is not much more because everything else works as before. And size and sum are easy to implement.
# Be careful with my 30 minutes bug: the input file may contain several test cases.
#
# The idea were found at https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/130521
